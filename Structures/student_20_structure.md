## What I See in My Data
Six "H-H" nodes are arranged in a hexagonal ring, with a seventh "H-H" node attached vertically to the bottom of the ring.
Connectors: Lines (/, \, |) link these nodes together.
Type: ZIGZAG
Peaks: 4
Color: BLUE

## What I Think This Means
The Layout: The hexagonal top implies a central hub or a loop, while the vertical line at the bottom suggests a base, stem, or entry point.
"BLUE" likely refers to the physical color of the object.
"ZIGZAG" might describe the path one takes to traverse the structure or the physical texture of the connections.
"PEAKS: 4" is puzzling because there are 7 distinct nodes. This suggests "Peaks" refers to elevation levels (vertical height tiers) rather than the total number of points.

## What This Could Be
A Blue Hexagonal Rope Climber
